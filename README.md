<h1>ATM Machine:</h1> This is a project from my class where we were tasked with refactoring selection keys for depositing and withdrawing money from an ATM.  
<h1>Description:</h1> Simple ATM project, you can deposit or get cash out. There is a warning if your withdraw is more than your account balance and a special note if you've saved 1 million dollars.
